# Fixing 500 Error on Vercel Deployment

## Issue

Your app was getting a 500 error due to missing environment variables, particularly Stack Auth configuration.

## Solution - Stack Auth Removed

The Stack Auth integration has been completely removed from the application to resolve the middleware errors you were experiencing.

### Required Environment Variables

1. **Database Configuration** (Optional)

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database?sslmode=require
   ```

2. **Builder.io Configuration** (Optional)
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY=your_builder_api_key
   ```

### How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project (`engage-x-bi19-3vlrfqalp`)
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add any environment variables you need (both are now optional)

### What Was Removed

- **Stack Auth**: Completely removed all Stack Auth integration and dependencies
- **Authentication**: No authentication system is currently active
- **Protected Routes**: All pages are now accessible without authentication
- **Middleware**: Simplified to basic request handling

### Current Application Status

1. The app should now load without 500 errors
2. No authentication is required to access any pages
3. All admin pages are publicly accessible
4. Database operations will work if you have configured DATABASE_URL

### Testing Locally

1. Run `npm run dev` to test locally
2. The app should work without any environment variables
